## Netflix

Netflix is one of the most popular streaming services in the world, with a vast collection of movies and TV shows. With so many options available, it can be challenging to choose what to watch. Fortunately, Tableau can help explore the Netflix catalog and make informed decisions about what to stream next.

I utilized charts to find relations between the Movies and TV Shows 
i. Countries: The bright red show that majority of Movies and TV Shows production are from the United States of America. While few productions are made in countries showing lighter red.
ii. Rating: This indicates that TV-MA (Matured Audience Only) program have the highest rating at 3,207. While the lowest rating goes to NC-17 (Not for Children Under 17) at 3.
iii. Distribution: Indicates the distribution between Movies and TV Shows, which leave Movies as the highest 69.62% and TV Shows at 30.38%
iv. Genre: With genre is shows that viewers prefer Drama, International Movies than others.
v. Years: It indicates that Movies have always dominated the industry with higher production than TV Shows each year.
vi. I also categorized the TV show/series, The Blacklist into type, title, rating, duration, date added, description, release year, genre and release year.
